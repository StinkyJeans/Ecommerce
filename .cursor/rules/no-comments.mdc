# No comments in source code

- Do **not** add any comments (e.g. `//`, `/* */`, `{/* */}`) in source code files.
- This applies to all JavaScript, TypeScript, JSX, and CSS in this project.
- Documentation files (e.g. `.md`) are excluded; they may use markdown and prose as needed.
- When editing or generating code, write self-explanatory names and structure instead of commenting.
- Do not add comments in the future; the only exception is documentation in `.md` files.
